This code conducts thermomechanical simulation for CSP receivers. As the receivers experience periodic thermal loading, the fatigue and rupture life are concerns.
By coupling the elastic strain with creep strain, the stress relaxation in CSP receivers can be investigated and the final fatigue and rupture life can be predicted.

To use this code, you need to create the mesh and facet marker files for the receiver (Gmsh is recommended) and provide the temperature profile (temperature with coordinates).
